Generate a profile for your organization and share it in the Murmurations network

== Description ==

Murmurations is a distributed data sharing network built to help connect regenerative economy projects and organizations and make them visible to the world and each other.

The network is comprised of:

- [Nodes](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#node) and other data hosts that share data in the network
- An [Index](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#index) that keeps track of what data is available in the network, and where it is located
- [Aggregators](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#aggregator) that collect data from the network and display it in various ways
- A [Library](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#library) of schemas that describe the data in the network

This plugin 
To enable these entities to work together, Murmurations provides:

- A protocol for defining and exchanging data about and amongst organizations, based on existing standards such as [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) and [REST APIs](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api).
- An [Index](https://index.murmurations.network/v2/nodes), a [Library](https://library.murmurations.network/v2/schemas) and a user-friendly data host (our [Profile Generator](https://tools.murmurations.network/profile-generator))) which enables organizations to quickly add themselves to the network.
- [Open source plug-ins and other code](https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork) to make it as easy as possible to use, share and contribute data to the network in a decentralized way.

The initial use case for Murmurations was to facilitate decentralized mapping of purpose-driven and solidarity economy organizations and projects.

Further historical background is in the 2019 [Murmurations Whitepaper](https://murmurations.network/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/murmurations-white-paper-v0.1.0.pdf).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

The Murmurations Protocol enables individuals and organizations (Nodes) to create Profiles about themselves in order to easily share information with Aggregators, who create Schemas to define the data they need to create maps, directories and content aggregators.

= Can you explain the terms you use? =

See the common terms we use when working with Murmurations and our blog posts Murmurations explained, and using Murmurations. https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html
