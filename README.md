Generate a profile for your organization and share it with the Murmurations network

== Description ==

### Add your Organisation to the Murmurations network for greater exposure and discovery via the [Murmurations Map](https://map.murmurations.network/) and other aggregators.

Help create a data commons of solidarity and regenerative economy projects and organisations.

This lightweight plugin, which is simple to install and setup, will create a .JSON profile for your Organisation and submit it to the Murmurations Index in just a few clicks, to make it easier for other people and organisations to discover your site and benefit from your work.

Once you have created a Profile your website will appear on the [Murmurations Map](https://map.murmurations.network/) and can be easily found and included by other aggregators who use the Murmurations network.

Your Murmurations Profile, which you own and control via the backend of your Wordpress, can result in multiple listings on other maps and directories, reducing the need to update multiple, identical listings on other sites.

####BACKGROUND

[Murmurations](https://murmurations.network) is an open source decentralised data sharing project, which provides a [flexible approach to ontology](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/ontology-composability.html) to accelerate the use of interoperable, [composable data](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/ontology-composability.html#data-composability). We want to put end users in charge of their data and to increase the reliability, integrity, and portability of data to help connect regenerative economy projects and organizations and make them visible to each other and the world.

The network is comprised of:

- [Nodes](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#node) and other data hosts that share Profile data with the network
- An [Index](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#index) that keeps track of what data is available in the network, and where it is located
- [Aggregators](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#aggregator) that collect data from the network and display it in various ways
- A [Library](https://docs.murmurations.network/about/common-terms.html#library) of schemas comprised of standardized data fields that describe the data in the network

We run two versions of the Murmurations tools and Index.
Please only publish genuine profiles to the Live API. For testing use the Test API.
